While Loop : Spit out information as long as conditions are true

 $x = 1;

 while($x < 5){
    echo "hi there<br>";
    $x++; //Will increment after each loop
 }

Do While : Always going to write/loop out once, even if while state is not true

$x = 10;

do{
  echo "hi there<br>";
  $x++;
}

 while($x < 5);

 For Loop :3 different parameters, tell us how many times we need to do something

 for($x = 0; $x <= 10; $x++;){
      echo "hi<br>";
 }

 Foreach Loop : Inside parenthesis, refer to an array

 $array = array("Daniel","Jane","Jacob");

foreach ($array as $loopdata){
  echo "My name is ".$loopdata."<br>";
}
